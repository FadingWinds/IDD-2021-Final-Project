# Tangible Cryptocurrency Safe

Wenqing Tang and Heidi He

Our project will design a tangible safe that stores the user's cryptocurrency token in Raspberry Pi that are not connected to the Internet.

Users can secure their tokens with password that will be a combination of keypad input and qwiic twist input. The safe will have also a small screen to display text, a microphone to collect audio input and a speaker to output sounds.
